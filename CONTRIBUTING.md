### Ollama
This is the best AI I could find, so here:
[Go here to install](https://ollama.ai)

To install and run Llama2 (Facebook's AI) - 
```ollama run llama2 text?```
Replace *text* with actual text, and if *text* is not specified, it will open up a repl. 
Be aware, as llama2 takes 4GB to install.
